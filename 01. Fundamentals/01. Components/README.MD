## Create a Greet Component
Create a new file called Greet.jsx and inside that file, write a Greet component using the function declaration syntax.
Afterward, refactor the Greet component to use the arrow function syntax.
Finally, register the Greet component in your App.jsx file so that you can see the result when running the app.
